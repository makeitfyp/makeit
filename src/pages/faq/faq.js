We have used inception model as it gave us the highest accuracy of all the models that we had tried. Basically, when a user sends the image to our model. It firstly resizes & rescales the image and then converts it to numpy array. The array is then passed to the 1st layer of our model where it then collects the brightest nodes after performing activation functions. Then these nodes are passed to next and so on. In the final layer that has 17 nodes, the model converts the array into lenght of 17 and the highest value out of 17 indexes represents the Food class name. This module is implemented using streamlit framework based on python.',
